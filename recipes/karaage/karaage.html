    <h2>Flavorful, Boneless, Incredibly Crispy and Crunchy Appetizer</h2>
    <p>
      The greatest fried chicken recipes of all time,
      <strong><em>karaage</em></strong> has to be at or near the top of that
      list. This Japanese-style fried chicken is crispy, juicy, and intensely
      flavorful, which is even more impressive when you consider the fact that
      there is no skin or bones involved. However, not all karaage recipes are
      created equal, and the awesomeness is very much dependent on how and what
      you coat your chicken pieces in.

    <h2>Follow the steps to make the recipe :</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sake, mirin, sesame oil, black pepper,
        cayenne, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken in the marinade and mix until thoroughly and evenly
        coated. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 10 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set up your dredging station: Place a wire rack over a foil-lined baking
        sheet. Add potato starch to a wide, shallow bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken from the refrigerator. Stir to coat with marinade. Toss 2
        or 3 pieces at a time in the potato starch until evenly coated. Shake
        off any excess starch and place chicken on the wire rack. Repeat to
        dredge remaining pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tap the rack on the baking sheet to remove any loose chunks of starch,
        then transfer the baking sheet and rack of chicken to the refrigerator
        for 15 to 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Without crowding, lower chicken carefully into the hot oil in batches.
        Fry, tossing occasionally, until cooked through and the outside is
        crunchy and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined
        plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken.
      </li>
