      <li>
        In a food processor or in a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour,
        white flour, wheat germ or oats, baking powder, baking soda, brown
        sugar, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the butter into small pieces with a knife, and add the butter to the
        flour-mixture. Mix until the mixture has a sand-like consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a well in the center of the flour-butter mixture, and add the
        buttermilk and eggs. Stir until the liquids are fully incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a frying pan over medium heat and grease the surface with 1
        tablespoon of butter or oil. Ladle the batter onto the surface to form 4
        inch pancakes. Once bubbles form on the top of the pancakes, flip them
        over, and cook them on the other side for about 2 minutes.
